Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes, as the included terminal is part of the core-editor.

2. Remove access to filesystem /etc/shells (e.g. by restricting fs-access)
4. Log-output shows that /etc/shells cannot be read (obviously)
Explanation: Sometimes this file might not be accessible or available.
Semantically, this should result in expected behavior: If `/etc/shells` file does not exist, any attempt of reading it is useless.
Needing to acknowledge a notification every time a user opens the program seems overly intrusive? 
A missing shells file just implies that the system does not provide that information. 
As there is already some way to configure the terminal profile explicitly, I don't consider the missing (and implicit!) system information harmful? 
Even with no configuration, the terminal stays somewhat usable _(no hard program-crash or similar!)_. 
Is this the right set-up? The Terminal output is empty, no error or warning
