2 - Why is history action appearing in not focused?
History hint was added in #129324
FYI @gjsjohnmurray the history hint causes some localization issues. 
I'll fix it up, but your review would be helpful
Fixes #197071
After (same as before for English):

- `or` will be localized
the spaces can be removed from the history hint suffix If it makes sense in the language
the arrow symbol will not be surfaced to translators
