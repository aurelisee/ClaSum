**Steps to Reproduce**
1. In VSCode, open two terminals
I was looking into this issue, and like @SimonSiefke suspected, it seems like in this instance, the aria-title is a Markdown string, which is why it's showing up as an object. 
I'm not exactly sure what the best way to handle the Markdown string would be. 
Would that be sufficient, or should I look for another solution? 
Not exactly sure of the guidelines surrounding aria.
Can you call `.toString()` on the markdown string? 
If not, using the tooltip seems fine.
Because the IIconLabelValueOptions interface accepts both a string or a markdown string for the title, I'm unsure of a function that will allow me to just get the markdown property without causing other issues. 
Plus, in this case, I don't know if the string is even suitable for an aria-label.
