- VS Code Version: 1.83 & 1.84-insider NOT: 1.80.2
OS Version: macOS AMD64
Steps to Reproduce:
2. When opening the `Quickfixes...` menu, the code action command is automatically executed on mouse-over/selection.
This is happening with current vscode versions, but not with 1.80.2 released in June, both using the same Snyk extension version. 
Sorry to ping again about it, but this is rather a bad UX for users - any chance to have a look at it, @mjbvz?
I wasn't able to repro then in flutter, but taking a look at it again
Looking into this atm! @bastiandoetsch I'm unable to recreate in the Synk extension - is there a specific command that the extension contributes that causes this?
"Local" code actions that directly interface with VSCode don't show this behavior.
1. Install the Snyk extension
3. Run an IaC or Snyk Code scan (Snyk Open Source only exhibits this behaviour if you install the "Preview" Snyk extension)
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No
VS Code Version: September 2023 (version 1.83)
OS Version: Apple M2
Auto insertion happens when I hover the mice over the suggestions in "Quick Fix".
1. Install Flutter Toolkit extension
2. Create a new class with some parameters
@luizcamposmc I was unable to reproduce this. 
Does this happen in the latest 1.84 release and is it only with flutter/dart?
closing as it's a /duplicate #196589
Code actions that didn't have definite edits were being re-run via the additional call to resolve (which called resolveCodeAction when there were no edits), which results in some code actions being immediately run on hover.
