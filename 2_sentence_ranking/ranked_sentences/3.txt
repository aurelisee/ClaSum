I was actually incorrect when I posted my version number initially. I **am** definitely running on `1.84.1`. 
And the issue remains the same as my original post. 
This issue seems to also affect me, I am currently using the insider build of VSCode, but I also tried the latest release, and it also has this bug.
I have the same problem on VS Code 1.84.1, Windows 11, disabling all installed extensions doesn't help.
I had the same problem, I installed an older version to fix it.
It started from the latest VS Code update.
Hello, I want to report a problem with color selection.
When selecting a color in the RGBA color palette, it automatically closes and adds the wrong code.

I can reproduce this issue on Ubuntu 22.04.2 with VS Code 1.84 installed as a Snap, and also with VS Code Insiders 1.85 (`f346494c77e1245505e53a2ddcab3bfb4ee52e08`) installed as a Snap.
I wonder if this is related in any way to #136965?

Because I wasn't implying that they are the same issue, and if you compare the behaviour described, they are different. 
I was only asking (the maintainers) if they are _related_.
### What I did
The reason for the issue is that whenever a color is picked through any of the selectors, a change is immediately triggered on the editor. 
That triggers the editor's `onDidChangeModelContent` emitter, therefore the hover widget triggers the `_hideWidgets` method.
Hey guys, I took a look and it was actually a recent change that caused the issue.

I just need some help with debugging the previous issue https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/196660 in order to make sure that this is not introducing regressions on that one.
(ref #198066)
Version: 1.84.2 (user setup)
Hi @mk8270 the fix is in Insiders 1.85 or the next release of stable, which will come out in two weeks. 
You may download the Insiders version of VS Code on https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/
What version of VS Code are you using @Irohukl?
