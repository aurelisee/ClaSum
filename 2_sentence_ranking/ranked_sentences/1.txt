I have seen this occasionally too, but haven't discovered a repro.
joyceerhl if you repro, then please `vscode-bisect` it to the change!
???? `vscode-bisect` claims there is no released insiders for 657bb89984f37b810b250955570593cde0cd62eb even though I got that from the insiders builds page after checking `Show released only` based on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/197755#issuecomment-1811538701
I cannot repro in Code-OSS :( 
@joyceerhl `vscode-bisect` goes over unreleased builds as well. 
What is the commits range?
@joyceerhl thats a different bu
FWIW, I tried debugging in dev tools
@joyceerhl interesting, I wonder if maybe we cannot find the `window` for the element in `getDomNodePagePosition`, there were recent changes. 
* ???? sometimes the dropdown shows at (0,0) but not always
When attempting to hover a dropdown list, it will jump to (0,0). 
Then when trying to hover it while it's at (0,0) will cause it to jump back to the list it came from.
OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.22631
- VSCode Insiders `1.85.0-insider`
I did not personally see this issue until tonight.
It started on a previous version of Insiders, but I allowed it to update before coming to file a bug report to see if it was a known issue that was already fixed. 
It is still happening on the latest. 
But seems to be happening less frequently now.
Edit: There is another bug with the dropdown menus that may potentially help with this issue as it has a similar effect. 
If you open the Settings UI, open a dropdown, then close the Settings UI window by clicking its 'x' in the tab, the dropdown list will remain visible. 
Hovering over this list will cause it to jump to (0,0) as well. _(Hovering on it at (0,0) wont cause it to keep moving in this situation though.)_
Here is a video showing this additional bug:

@bpasero I cannot repro anymore in the latest Insiders :+1:
