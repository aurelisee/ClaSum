I tested on Win11 & Win10.
It works as long as you start a new workbook and don't save the Jupyter notebook. 
Once you save the notebook, your pastes of images from the clipboard will no longer be treated as inline attachments.

Possibly getting overridden by a markdown file paste provider? @mjbvz

All cases are performed with a screenshot copied to the clipboard and pasting into markdown notebook cells using ctrl+v. 
Using Windows 11 and current insiders.

With setting `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": false`

  - `ctrl+v` results in correct inline attachment image link pasted, renders correctly
The version I just tested with is updated now and it is working as expected with the `"ipynb.pasteImagesAsAttachments.enabled": true`

Will disable pasting into untitled notebooks with the setting off
Since the notebook does not exist on disk yet, there's no way to write a relative path in it. 
Just disable the feature since there's nothing else we can reasonably do here
