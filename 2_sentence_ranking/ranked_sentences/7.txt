Explorer shows but the file is not revealed. 
let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('test-ext.helloWorld', () => {
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('revealInExplorer', uri);

Seems to be caused by this code which triggers a second call to reveal the active editor file when the explorer is revealed:
This one was quite challenging; there are two race conditions here both preventing selecting directories the first when no files are open and the second when an active file is open. 
This is caused by the visibility callback firing and resetting the tree input and then selecting the active file. 
Both of these can mess with a selection that was applied earlier.
I don't get what "Explorer shows but the file is not revealed." means. 
@rzhao271 When this command is run, it is supposed to open the explorer and also highlight/select the target file in the explorer.
That second part is what wasn't working
If the explorer is already open and I do the same thing, it works.
If explorer.autoReveal=false, then it works.

It does in the latest version; I tested in multiple different installations with different versions + extensions, just happened to use an older one to submit...
