OS Version: Linux x64 3.13.0-108-generic
1.Start debugging a vscode extension
2.Reload the vscode window that just opened (which has the extension running)
3.The window closes instead of reloading
1.does not always happen
2.in those cases when it happens I am getting a broadcast of `vscode:extensionTerminate` instead of `vscode:extensionAttach`
3.Looking at the [extensionHost.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/extensionHost.ts#L101) it seems like the extensionTerminate is only sent `onWIllShutdown`
1. Open folder with extension
2. F5 extension
3. In extension's workbench try to open a different folder
4. -> Extension's workbench closes, but does not reopen with new folder
